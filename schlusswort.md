# Conclusion

Dear reader, I hope you actually learned and understood something while reading this book. It took me about 1.5 years to work on the book \(apart from the last two months before publication not full time of course\). A lot has happened in this time, many things have changed so significantly that I have postponed the release of the book several times by a few days to weeks, because I did not want to have outdated material in the book on the day of publication.

Unfortunately, some of the topics that I wanted to give more space to in this book, but which on the other hand are not necessarily such a central part of React as to delay the release even further, have been neglected or not described at all. Optimizing the build setup with Webpack is one of these topics. On this topic I found another book on Amazon with about 500 pages. That would have definitely gone beyond the scope of this. 

Other topics like Server Side Rendering I also mentioned only marginally. Although I think the topic is important, after some projects I got the impression that the benefits of server side rendering don't always outweigh the costs.

This book will also be publicly available on GitHub when it is published. In the days after the release I will create some issues here, with which you can vote on which topics, which are still missing in the book, are important. I will then gradually add new chapters and more content to the book as needed. 

By the way, I'm also happy about [Issues](https://github.com/manuelbieh/react-book/issues) whenever you find an error in the book. Whether spelling mistakes, grammar or inhatlicher nature. Since I publish the book on my own, I had no access to the comprehensive editing provided by the major publishers. However, I wanted to retain full control over all rights and publication channels. And this also includes the free online version at [https://lernen.react-js.dev/](https://lernen.react-js.dev/) - unfortunately this would not have been possible with many publishers.

In the past years I have accompanied many exciting projects through React, learned a lot about frontend and UI development and last but not least met many great people through working with React. I just wanted to give these experiences back to the community a bit, which is why the HTML version is free and will always remain so!

If you want to support me and my work, you can buy the eBook for Kindle, Apple Books or Google Play Books for what I think is a very fair price and read the book comfortably on your preferred reading device. And of course I'm always happy about interesting inquiries about projects with a focus on React \(clear, what else?\) in Berlin. 

More about me can be found on my website: [https://www.manuelbieh.de/](https://www.manuelbieh.de/) - which, how else could it be, was developed with Gatsby.

I am happy about any feedback from you, no matter if positive or negative! You can also reach me on Twitter at [@manuelbieh](https://www.twitter.com/manuelbieh).
