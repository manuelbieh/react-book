# Sources of Information

Most of the information sources related to React are in English. Even German native speakers have partly written English books or write their newsletters or blogs in English, because a much larger target group can of course be reached. This was and is one of the reasons why I wrote this book in German: I think there are many German-speaking developers out there who would like to read into a topic in their native language.

However, this does not change the fact that almost all information sources out there are only in English. So you can't completely avoid English if you don't just want to read it, but also want to stay up to date at all times. Therefore I apologize for the fact that the sources of information here are mostly only mentioned in English.

## Twitter

Twitter has always been a highly topical source when it comes to knowing what's hot at the moment. The React team also regularly publishes new changes on Twitter in a very timely manner. So if you don't have an account here yet, but want to stay up to date regularly, you should get an account as soon as possible and have a look there from time to time.

I'm pretty sure I'm going to do wrong to a lot of people by listing a lot of accounts here that I think write interesting tweets about React very regularly and for the most part. Because I probably won't mention as many accounts as I think would be worth mentioning. However, here is a list of accounts I follow myself and can recommend without restriction:

## Newsletter

Don't worry, here I don't mean the advertising slingshots that every one of us constantly gets unasked for and with which one wonders whether one has really ever registered there. In the React scene there are actually a lot of very interesting, lovingly maintained and beautifully designed newsletters that are definitely worth subscribing to. Most of them are sent out weekly and contain a good overview of what happened in the React world last week. For anyone who finds Twitter too fast-paced, stressful or exhausting:

* [React Status](https://react.statuscode.com/) \(Peter Cooper / Cooperpress\)
* [This Week in React](https://this-week-in-react.org/) \(Philipp Spiess\)
* [React.js Newsletter](http://reactjsnewsletter.com/) \(Tyler McGinnis\) 
* [Fullstack React](http://newsletter.fullstackreact.com) \(Sophia Shoemaker\)
* [React Digest](https://reactdigest.net/) \(Jakub Chodounsky / Bonobopress\)

## Podcasts

As with the newsletters, there are some high quality podcasts about React, but I only know English podcasts here. If this doesn't deter you, you might want to listen to the following podcasts:
