# V - The Ecosystem

For one curse, for another blessing: the **freedom** that **React** offers the developer. 

While full-fledged frameworks like Angular provide very clear guidelines about how an application should be structured and also provide their own methods for data management, services and business logic as well as clear ways, React works according to the motto "bring your own" - so bring your own tool. 

As already mentioned at the beginning of this book, React is just a **library for the development of user interfaces** \(Small anecdote on the side: This sentence is one of the few I quoted in this book from the documentary that hasn't changed in the course of working on this book ;\)\). In the world of classical MVC \(_Model View Controller_\) architecture, so to speak, only the view layer. If you want an extended state management, if you want to develop your application multilingual or if you need client-side routing, React alone will often not make you happy.

But this is a very valuable and active ecosystem that has evolved around React, with tools that integrate well with a React setup and give developers the choice of choosing from multiple tools to find the one that best suits their personal tastes. If none fits at all, this is usually no problem and React offers with its variety of functions and APIs the possibility to develop a robust, own solution.

Since it can happen very fast that you lose the overview due to the multitude of libraries, I would like to deal in this chapter with the most common tools and libraries, which have proven themselves in the daily work with React and often have thousands of stars on Github and are installed ten thousand times or \(clearly\) more over `npm`.
