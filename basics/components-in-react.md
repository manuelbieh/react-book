# Components in React

## The two types of React components

We've already implemented our first `Hello World` component in the section "Into the deep end". While this component taught us the basics of **React** and **React components**, it was a simplistic example and did not make use of everything React offers.

**Components** are relatively easy to explain: they allow us to de-construct complex user interfaces into multiple parts. Ideally, these parts are reusuable, isolated and closed in itself. They can deal with any input from the outside so-called **props** \(from "properties"\) and describe what's going to be rendered on the screen by whatevert they define in the `render()` method.
