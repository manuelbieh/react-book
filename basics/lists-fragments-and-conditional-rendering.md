# Lists, Fragments, and Conditional Rendering

You have learned a lot about React so far. You now know why we need **props**, what **state** is and how it differs from **props**, you've learned how to implement a React component as well as to differenciate between a React **component** and a React **element**. You also learned how to use **JSX** to accurately depict the tree of elements that's being rendered and how you can leverage **lifecycle methods** to react to changes in our data. All of these lay the groundwork for simple React applications.

But there a few details that we have not examined yet and which have not been mentioned so far \(or not explained in detail\). However, these details will become more relevant the more complex our applications get.

**Lists** \(as in working with data arrays\), so-called **Refs** \(which are references to the DOM representation of a React element\), **Fragments** \(a special component that does not leave traces or elements in the output\) and **Conditional Rendering** based on props and state are part of these details and will thus be examined in this section.

They are too important to not mention them in the Basics section of the book but each topic on its own does not quite warrant its own chapter. Let's look at them now.
