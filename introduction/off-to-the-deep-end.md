# Into to the deep end

We've just talked about the "What", "When" and "Where" but we haven't yet talked about the "How". Let's write our first little **React component.** In order to display our component in the browser, we need to not only install **React** but also **ReactDOM**, a package that enables us to mount our application in the browser. Simply put: to use it in the browser. 

Let's have a look at a very minimalist setup to get started with React:

```markup
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
<title>Hallo React!</title>
</head>
<body>
<div id="root"></div>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.8.4/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.8.4/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
<script>
// Platzhalter f√ºr unsere erste Komponente
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

We build up the bare bones set up for a regular HTML document and load in **React** and **ReactDOM** in their latest _stable_ version from unpkg-CDN. We can now use React and ReactDOM as a global variable in the window object as `window.React` and `window.ReactDOM`. Apart from that we only see a an empty page here with an empty `<div id="root"></div>`. This div is going to be used as our **mount node** to show our first React component. 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have a number of React components, you normally refer to an **app**, **web app** or **single page app**. The boundaries of when you call a component an app are fluid though. A few developers talk of an **app** if we only have a single component in our code. A clear definition of this does not exist though.
{% endhint %}

Let's start with a classic "Hello-World" example and include the script where we've put the placeholder earlier.

```javascript
class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return React.createElement(
      'div', 
      { id: 'hello-world' }, 
      'Hello World'
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(HelloWorld), 
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

And just like that we have just implemented our first React component. If we include this snippet where we have put the placeholder earlier, we can see the following in the browser:

![Our first React component in the browser](../.gitbook/assets/first-component.png)

That does not look that complicated, does it? Let's go through the code one by one. I have highlighted all the relevant parts in the code in bold.

```jsx
class HelloWorld 
```

Here, we are giving a name to a child component. We have named our first component **HelloWorld.** You can name your components anything you like, but there is one rule to keep in mind: React components start with a capital letter. Using helloWorld as your component name would not be valid, HELLOWORLD however would be \(if highly unlikely to see in the wild\). 

Naming your components follow the **UpperCamelCase** convention. It is not unusual either to have long, self-explanatory names for your components. **UserNotificationView** is an entirely normal name.

```jsx
extends React.Component
```

With this snippet, we're extending the internal React class `React.Component`. This transforms our own class into a component that we can use in React. Apart from `React.Component` there is also a `React.PureComponent`.and a so-called _functional component_. This is simply a JavaScript function that follows a particular pattern. We are going to look at both of these at a later stage, for our current understanding we can neglect them for now.   

```jsx
render()
```

So far, our component only contains the obligatory `render()` method. This method is necessary to inform React how the component is displayed - we say "rendered". A component has to have a `return` value. This value can either be an explicit `null` value to show nothing \(but not `undefined`\), another **React element**, or from Version 16 onward, a **string** or **array**. 

In terms of an array, the array can include strings, numbers, React elements or `null` as values. The `render()` method **declaratively** describes the current state of our user interface. Everything that is included in our render method right after `return` is what the browser will display after rendering. 

Even if it is entirely up to you how to structure your JavaScript classes, a common pattern has evolved to put your `render()` method at the end of all your methods. This is not mandatory of course but it aids readability. Thus many renowned engineers in the React scene advocate for this guideline too. The code guidelines by AirBnB also include this rule. Speaking from my own experience here, I can say that it does help to follow this guideline to make your day-to-day React work easier.

```jsx
React.createElement()
```

As mentioned previously, the `render()` method of a React component returns a **React element**  in most cases. React **elements** are the smallest but also most significant building blocks in a React application and describe what a user will see on their screen in the end. Apart from `React.cloneElement()`and `React.isValidElement()` , `React.createElement()` has been one of of the only 3 top level API methods for a long time. Since then though, a few other methods have been added but they are mainly for performance optimizations. 

The `createElement()` method expects 1-n parameters:

1. "Type" - this can be a HTML element as a string, i.e. `'div'` , `'span'` or `'p'` but also other React components.
2. So-called "Props" - these are read-only "property objects" of a component.  The name is derived from - you guessed it - properties. 
3. As many child elements as you wish to put in. These can be React elements themselves, or arrays, functions or simply plain text. However, a component does not necessarily need to contain other child elements.

At the end of the day, **React elements** are not anything other than a never changing \(immutable\) JavaScript object that describes properties to tell React how and what exactly needs displayed. This description of properties is used by React to construct a virtual blueprint of the component hierarchy. It resembles the representation of the HTML tree in the form of a JavaScript object. You often hear it referred to as the VirtualDOM however the term is losing popularity with the React team and they have distanced themselves from the use of it. This tree is used by React in  turn to only refresh those parts of the tree that have actually changed, when a user interacts with an app and changes data or fires an event. To do this, the previous tree is compared to the current tree.

As React does not refresh the entire application at once and writes it to the DOM in its entirety once any state changes, it is a lot more performant than other frameworks or libraries. Other libraries or frameworks can often lead to unnecessarily many DOM mutations at the cost of performance. Using a special **reconciliation** algorithm that compares previous state with current state, React processes what exactly has changed, and can reduce the number of writes to a minimum.

However, in your day-to-day development you will hardly ever call `React.createElement()` in this form. Facebook has developed its own syntax extension for JavaScript called **JSX**. JSX reduces a great amount of work and simplifies a lot of work with React. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that it is good to know of `React.createElement()`'s existence to understand how JSX works behind the scenes and to reduce the number of errors when debugging.

**JSX** resembles HTML or XML/XHTML in parts, however it is a lot more powerful as you can include JavaScript expressions within it. JSX is an abstraction that makes it a lot **easier** for the developer to create React elements. Our previous example

```jsx
React.createElement('div', {id: 'hello-world'}, 'Hello World');
```

would look like this in JSX:

```jsx
<div id="hello-world">Hello World</div>
```

For many beginners, this can look a little strange in the beginning. I have seen this referred to as **JSX shock** but after playing around with JSX for a little while, its practicality becomes obvious. In my opinion, JSX is one of the reasons why React's usage has gained so much traction in such a short time.

Let's have a look at our example again. The `return`value of the `render()` method indicates that it will display an element of type `div` which shall contain the id `hello-world` and the child element \(a text node in this case\) containing `Hello World`. 

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(Element, Container)
```

We have talked about most of the parts in our example but we have not yet looked at **ReactDOM**. This library enables React to interact with the DOM \(_Document Object Model_\), put simply it allows us to interact with the browser. Just as React itself, **ReactDOM** only contains a few top level API methods. We are going to concentrate on the `render()` method - the core of **ReactDOM** in the browser.

Although the naming might suggest otherwise, **ReactDOM**'s internal `render()` method does not directly relate to its counterpart used in React components. Using it in this case, enables us to render a **React element**  onto a **"root node"**, meaning to display it on the screen. In our example, we render our `HelloWorld` component onto the `<div id="root"></div>`. It is important to understand that the root node is **not replaced**, but that the content is inserted **into the container**.

**ReactDOM** enables us to actually see our component in the browser. The actual content that we can see is described in the `render()` method which contains a React element after the `return`. Callling `ReactDOM.render()` with the two parameters as shown above, will insert the **React** element into the given **container**. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Calling the `ReactDOM.render()` function for the first time, any possibly existing content in the destination container is being replaced. With every subsequent call, React uses an internal comparison algorithm for best performance and to avoid re-rendering the entire application.

While this is good to know in the theory, you normally do not call `ReactDOM.render()` more than once and only use it to initialise your Single Page App to load the page. React never changes the root node itself, only its contents. This means that if your container element has classes, ids or a data-attribute, these will remain intact after calling `ReactDOM.render()`.
{% endhint %}

And just like that, we have discussed the basics of how React works under the hood, implemented our first component and finally displayed it in the browser.
